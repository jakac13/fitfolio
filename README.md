 Markup : *Developed a digital closet application using Flutter framework
          *Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing clothes items
          *Designed the app with a focus on user experience (UX) to ensure easy navigation and optimal functionality
          *Incorporated camera and image selection capabilities for adding new clothes items to the digital closet

          *Employed the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern to improve scalability and maintainability of the codebase
          *Managed the application state using the Provider package to ensure a streamlined user experience
          *Cached images using the cached_network_image package for improved performance.
