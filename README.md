# Fitfolio - Landing Page
[Webpage Link](https://jakac13.github.io/fitfolio/)

A simple landing page that displays the whole process of creating my own Flutter Mobile Application. Designed and developed a landing page from scratch using native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## Current Features
- Developed a digital closet application using Flutter framework
- Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing clothes items
- Designed the app with a focus on user experience (UX) to ensure easy navigation and optimal functionality
- Incorporated camera and image selection capabilities for adding new clothes items to the digital closet
- Utilized Firebase for storing the data, with images saved in Firebase Storage and clothing items saved in the Realtime Database
- Enabled user authentication with Google sign-in functionality
- Employed the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern to improve scalability and maintainability of the codebase
- Managed the application state using the Provider package to ensure a streamlined user experience
- Cached images using the cached_network_image package for improved performance.

## Future Features
- Outfit Creation: With our app, you can create new outfits using your saved clothes. This feature will help you experiment with new looks and put together outfits that you may not have thought of before.
- Tagging and Calendar: To help you keep track of what you've worn, our app also allows you to tag outfits with the date you wore them. You can then view your tagged outfits on a calendar, making it easy to see what you wore on any given day and plan future outfits accordingly.
